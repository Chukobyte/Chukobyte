#### Hi, I'm Michael Smith, AKA Chukobyte

I'm a professional game developer that works on too many personal projects at once ðŸ¤”!  I enjoy developing games, game engines, and participating in game jams.

##### What I'm Working On Currently

* The game titled [Serenade of the Sirens](https://store.steampowered.com/app/901000/Serenade_of_the_Sirens/) (closed source)
* A game engine called [Seika Engine](https://chukobyte.itch.io/seika)
* A game engine [tutorial series](https://chukobyte.github.io/learn-engine-dev/)
